# Master Frontend Module 7: Cloud - Auto ☁️  ☁️  ☁️ 


### Statement ✨: 

- Automate the application process:

    - Have a repository on Github.
    - Want to display a demo page.
    - We want every time a merge with master is done to trigger a build and use flow.
    - Use Github actions for this.


* The code is a boilerplate used exclusively to be able to deploy this repository on Github Pages
